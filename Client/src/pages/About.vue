        <p class="lead">Established in 2024, we are a cafe founded based in New Paltz. Founded by students, we wanted to
          create a spot for local coffee and tea lovers. We work to hone our craft and provide the best drinks
          complimented with savory
          baked goods. We strive to create a cozy and welcoming environment for all our customers.

        <p class="lead">We are proud to be a part of the New Paltz community. We are dedicated to providing a space for
          students, faculty, and visitors to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. We take feedback seriously and are always open to suggestions through our anonymous surveys.
          We also love hosting interactive events as they are integral to ensuring that our customers feel at home. All of our events can be found on our Instagram page @morningnightcafe. As our way of giving back to the community around us,
          we also love to collaborate with local businesses. We are always looking for ways to give back to the community that has supported us since the beginning.
